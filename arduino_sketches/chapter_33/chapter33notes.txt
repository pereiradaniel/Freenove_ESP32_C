Chapter 33: TCP/IP

Project 33.1: ESP32 as client.

TCP Connection

    A TCP connection will need to be established before data can be transmitted.

    The client sends a connection request to the server. Each time request is proposed, a, "three-times handshake" is required.

        First handshake:
            Client sends a connection request to the server and waits for the server to confirm.
        
        Second handshake:
            Ther server sends a response back to the client, informing that it has received the connection request.
        
        Third handshake:
            Client sends a confirmation message to the server again to confirm the connection.
