TCP: Transmission Control Protocol

    What it is:

    - A communications standard that enables application programs and computing devices to exchange messages over a network.

    
    How it works:

    - It is designed to send packets across the internet and ensure the successful delivery of data and messages over networks.


    Why it is important:

    - TCP is one of the basic standards that defin the rules of the internet.

    - It is included within the standards defined by the IETF.

    - One of the most commonly used protocols within digital network communications.

    - Ensures end-to-end delivery.


IP: Internet Protocol

    What it is:

    - The method for sending data from one device to another across the internet.

    
    What it does:

    - Every device has an IP address that uniquely identifies it and enables it to communicate with and exchange data with other devices connected to the internet.

    
    Why it is important:
    
    - The statndard for fast and secure communication directly between mobile devices.

    - Responsible for defining how applications and devices exchange packets of data with each other.


    How it works:

    - The principal communications protocol responsible for the formats and rules for exchanging data and messages between computers on a single network or several internet-connected networks, done through TCP/IP.

    - IP is the main protocol within the internet layer of the TCP/IP.

        Internet Protocol Suite TCP/IP:

        - A group of communcations protocols that are split into four abstraction layers.


    How TCP/IP Works:

    IP obtains and defines the IP address of the application or device that the data must be sent to.

    TCP is responsible for transporting and routing data through the network architecture and ensuring it gets delivered to the destination application or device that IP has defined.
