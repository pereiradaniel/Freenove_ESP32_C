CHAPTER 25: Infrared Motion sensor
---------------------------------

Project 25.1: Infrared Motion Detector with LED Indicator.

Objective: Use an IR sensor to detect heat signatures.


Infrared Motion Sensor, HC SR-501.

    Description:
        Working voltage: 5v-20v(DC)
        
        Automatic trigger:
            When a body is detected in the sensor's detection area, the module will output HIGH level (3.3V).
            When the body leaves the sensor's active detection area, it will output HIGH level lasting for time period T, then out put low level (0V).
            Delay time T can be adjusted by the potentiometer R1.
            The position of the jumper cap can decide between non-repeatable trigger mode or repeatable mode.
        
            L: Non-repeatable mode.

                Outputs high level after sensing a body.
                When delay time is over, outputs low level.
                During high level time, the sensor no longer actively senses.

            H: Repeatable trigger mode.

                Difference from L mode is that it can sense a body until it leaves the detection area during that period of high level output. After this it starts to time and output low level after delaying T time.
            
            Induction block time:

                Induction will stay in block condition, does not induce external signal at lesser time inetervals (less than the delay time) and outputting high level or low level.

            Initialization time:

                Module needs about 1 minute to initialize after being powered ON.
                During this time period, it will alternately output high or low level.
