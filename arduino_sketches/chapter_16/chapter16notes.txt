# CHAPTER 16: 7-Segment Display

# Project 16.1: 7-Segment Display

Objective: Use 74HC595 to control 7-segment display and make it display hexadecimal character "0-F".

7-Segment Display
-----------------
    - A digital electronic display device.
    - 8 LEDs: Firgure 8 and a decimal point.
    - The 8 LEDs have a common anode and individual cathodes.

For detailed code values, please refer to the following table (common anode).

# Project 16.2: 4-Digit 7-Segment Display

4 Digit 7 Segment display
-------------------------
    - Integrates four 7 segment display modules into one module.
    - All of the LEDs contained havea a common anoed and individual cathodes.

    Display method:
        - Similar to 7 segment display, except each digit is shown in turn.


# Project 16.3: 74HC595 & LED Matrix

Objective: Use two 74HC595 IC chips to control a monochrome 8x8 LED matrix to display both simple graphics and characters.

LED Matrix
----------
    - Rectangular display module that consists of a uniform grid of LEDs.
    
    Two types of arrangements:

        1. Common Anode
            - Positive poles of the LEDs in each row and negative poles of LEDs in each column are connected together.
    
        2. Common Cathode
        - Negative poles of the LEDs in each row and positive poles of LEDs in each column are connected together.
    

# How the 8x8 LED matrix with common anode works:
    - Choose 16 ports on the ESP32 board to connect to the 16 ports of LED matrix.
    - Configure one port in columns for low level. This is now the selected port.
    - Then configure the eight port in the row to display content in the selected column.
    - Add a delay value and then select the next column that outputs the corresponding content. (Scanning).
