# CHAPTER 11: Potentiometer & LED

Review of knowledge:
- DAC output can drive an LED at varying voltage.
- The LED has a threshold voltage required for it to turn on.
- Another, more efficient method of LED brightness control is through use of a potentiometer.


# Project 11.1: Soft Light

Objective: Use and ADC module to read ADC values of a potentiometer, and map it to duty cycle of the PWM used to control the brightness of an LED.

Result: The brightness of an LED will be adjusted by a potentiometer.
