# CHAPTER 13: Thermistor

Thermistor
----------
    - Type of resistor:
        Temperature sensitive resistor.

    - Resistance value is dependent on:
        a. temperature
        b. changes in temperature

    - Can be used to create a thermometer.

Rt = R * EXP[ B * (1/T2 - 1/T1)]

Where:
    Rt      is the thermistor under T2 temperature.
    R       is the nominal resistance of thermistor under T11 temperature.
    EXP[n]  is nth power of E
    B       is for thermal index.
    T1, T2  is Kelvin temperature (absolute temperature).
            Kelvin temperature = 273.115 + Celsius temperature
            For the parameters of the thermistorm use:
                B=3950
                R=10k
                T1=25

The value measured by the ADC converter can be used to obtain the resistance value of the thermistor.

The temperature formula:

    T2 = 1 / ( 1/T1 + ln ( RT / R ) / B )
