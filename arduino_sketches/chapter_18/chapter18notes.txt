# CHAPPTER 18: Servo.

Servo:

    Consists of:
        1. DC motor
        2. Set of reduction gears to provide torque
        3. A sensor
        4. A control circuit board
    
    Differences with DC motor:
        - Servo can output higher torque
        - Used to control motion in model cars and airplanes, robots, etc.
    
    3 pins:
        #1 Signal.
        Power:
        #2 positive VCC
        #3 negative GND
    

# Determining the angle of the servo arm

    A 50Hz PWM signal with a duty cycle in a certain range will drive the servo.

    The lasting time of 0.5ms-2.5ms of PWM single cycle high level corresponds to the servo angle 0 - 180 degrees linearly:

        High Level Time         Servo Angle
        0.5ms                   0 degrees
        1ms                     45 degrees
        1.5ms                   0 degrees
        2ms                     45 degrees
        2.5ms                   180 degrees
