TCP Connection

    A TCP connection will need to be established before data can be transmitted.

    The client sends a connection request to the server. Each time request is proposed, a, "three-times handshake" is required.

        First handshake:
            Client sends a connection request to the server and waits for the server to confirm.
        
        Second handshake:
            Ther server sends a response back to the client, informing that it has received the connection request.
        
        Third handshake:
            Client sends a confirmation message to the server again to confirm the connection.

Brief description of TCP and some basics:
    
    TCP is a connection-oriented, low-level transmission control protocol.
    
    Establishing a connection
    
        After TCP establishes a connection, the client and server can send and receive messages to each other.

        The connection will always exist, so long as either the client or server do not initiate a disconnection.

        Each time one party sends a message, the receiver sends and acknowledgement.
