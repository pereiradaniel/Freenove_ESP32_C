CHAPTER 32: WiFi Working Modes

Three different WiFi operating odes of the ESP32:

    1. Station mode.
    2. AP mode.
    3. AP+Station mode.


Project 32.1: Station mode.

    Refernces:

        WiFi.h:
        https://docs.espressif.com/projects/arduino-esp32/en/latest/api/wifi.html

    When the ESP32 runs in Station mode, it acts as a WiFi client.
    It can connect to the router network, and communicate with other devices on the router.

    Names and Passwords:
    You will have to enter the correct router name and password in the Sketch in order to be abe to login to the network.

    Reference:
    Every time you want to use WiFi, a sketch must include WiFi.h.
    begin(ssid, password, channel, bssid, conect)
        - Esp32 is used as Station to connect hotspot.
        ssid: WiFi hotpost name
        password: WiFi hotpsot optional param,.
        channel: WiFi hotspot channel number, communicating through specified channel, optional parameter.
        bssid: mac address of WiFi hotspot, optional param.
        connect: booplean optional param, defaulting to true. If set to false, then ESP32 won't connect WiFi.
    
    config(local_ip, gateway, subnet, dns1, dns2)
        - Set static local IP address.
        local_ip: Station fixed IP address.
        subnet: subnet_mask.
        dns1, dns2: Optional params, defines IP address of domain name server.
    
    status: Obtain the connection status of WiFi.
    local IP(): Obtain lIP address in Sation Mode.
    disconnect(): Disconnect WiFi.
    setAutoConnect(boolean): Sets automatic connection every time ESP32 is powered on.
    setAutoReconnect(boolean): Set to automatically reconnect every time ESP32 is disconnected from WiFi.


Project 32.2: AP mode.

AP mode

    

WiFi API
    The wi-fi API provides support for the 802.11b/g/n protocol driver.

    This API includes:

        - Station mode.
            STA mode or Wi-Fi client mode.
            ESP32 connects to an access point.
        
        - AP mode.
            Soft-AP mode or Access Point mode.
            Devices connect to the ESP32.
        
        - Security modes (WPA2, WPA3, etc.)

        - Scanning for access points.
    
    Working as AP

        ESP32 is configured as an Access Point (AP).
        It is capable of receiving incoming connections from other devices (called "stations") by providing a Wi-Fi network.
