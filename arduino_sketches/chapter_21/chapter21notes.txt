HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Ranging Module
---------------------------------
    How it works:
        The ultrasonic rangind module works by sending out an ultrasonic wave, and receiving the reverb when it bounces back.
    
        The distance can be measured by counting the timme interval between sending and receiving the ultrasonic waves.

        The time difference is the total time of the ultrasonic wave's journey from transmission to reception.

        The speed of sound through the air is a constant:

            v = 340 ms

        The distance between the ultrasonic ranging module and the obstacle can be calculated thusly:

        Formula:

            s = vt / 2

    HC-SR04:
        Integrates both an ultrasonic transmitter and receiver.
        
        The transmitter:
            Used to convert electrical signals (electrical energy) into high frequency sound waves (mechanical energy) that are beyond the range of human hearing.
        
        The receiver:
            Does the opposite of the transmitter.
        
    Technical specifications:
        Working voltage:            5V
        Working current:            12mA
        Minimum measured distance:  2cm
        Maximum measured distance:  200cm
    
    PINS:

        PIN    |    Description
        -----------------------------
        VCC    |    Power supply pin.
        Trig   |    Trigger pin.
        Echo   |    Echo pin.
        GND    |    Ground.
        -----------------------------

    Intstructions for usage:
        1.  Output a high-level pulse in trigger pin lasting for at list 10us.
        2.  The mmodule begins to transmit ultrasonic waves.
        3.  At the same time, the Echo pin is pulled up.
        4.  When the module receives the returned ultrasonic waves from encountering an obstacle, the Echo pin will be pulled down.
        5.  The duration of high level in the Echo pin is the total time of the ultrasonic wave from transmitting to receiving, s=vt/2.
