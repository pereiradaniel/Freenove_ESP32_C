Component Knowledge
-------------------

Buzzer
    - Sounding component widely used in electronic devices.
    - Two types:
        1. Active
            - Has oscillator inside.
            - Will sound as long as it is supplied with power.
        2. Passive
            - Requires external oscillator signal (generally PWM) to make sound.
    
    - Active buzzers are easy to use, and generally only make a specific frequency of sound.
    - Passive buzzer requires an external circuit to make a sound, but it can be controlled to make a sound with different frequency.
    - Resonant frequency of the passive buzzer is 2kHz.

Transistor
    - Device that controls current.
    - Used to amplify weak signal, or works as a switch.
    - Has three electrodes: base (b), collector (c), and emitter (e).

    When there  is current passing between "be", "ce" will allow several-fold current (transistor magnification).

    When the current between "be" exceeds a certain value, "ce" will not allow current to increase.

    There are two types of transistor: PNP and NPN.

    - Transistors are often used as a switch in digital circuits.
    - Micro-controllers have low capacity to output current, a transistor may be used to amplify current.

    Using NPN:
        - If GPIO output is high, current will flow through R1, transistor will be conducted, buzzer will sound.
        - If GPIO output is low, not current flows through R1, transistor is not conducted, no buzzer sound.
    
    Using PNP:
        - If GPIO output is low, current will flow through R, transistor will be conducted, buzzer will sound.
        - If GPIO output is high, no current flows through R, transistor is not conducted, no buzzer sound.
