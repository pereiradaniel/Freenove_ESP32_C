    - RGB LED has 3 LEDs that can respectively emit red, green, blue.
    - 4 pins.
        Pin #1 (long pin): The common port, either pos or neg.
        Pin #2: Red.
        Pin #3: Green.
        Pin #4: Blue.
    - Combining these three lights in various ways can create almost all kinds of visible coloured lights.

    Using three 8-bit PWMs to control RGB LED:
        - In theory, 2^8*2^8*2^8=16777216 (16 million) colours can be created.

Bytes in Arduino Sketches:
    - Used to represent an 8-bit unsigned integer, capable of holding a value from 0 to 255.
    - Preferred in several scenarios:
        1. Memory Efficiency: Usin byte instead of larger data types like int (16 bits) can save memory.
        2. Clarity and consistency: Recommended over unsigned char for clarity and consistency in Arduino programming style. Makes code more readable and easier to understand.
        3. Suitability for PIN numbers and small values: Since pin nunmbers and many small integer values in Arduino projects fall within the range of 0 to 255, byte is more appropriate.

byte()
 - Converts a value into the byte data type.
    Syntax
    - byte(x)
    - (byte)x   // C-style type conversion
    Returns
    - Data type: byte.

Primarily designed to control the intensity of LEDs.
