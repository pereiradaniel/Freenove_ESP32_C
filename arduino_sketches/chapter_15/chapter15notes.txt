# CHAPTER 15: 74HC595 & LED Bar Graph

Objective: Control an LED bar using 74HC595 in order to conserve GPIO ports.

74HC595
    - Chip used to convert serial data into parallel data.
    - Can convert the serial data of one byte into 8 bits, and send its corresponding level to each of the 8 ports.
    - Can be used to expand the IO ports of an ESP32.
    - At least 3 ports are required to control the 8 ports of the 74HC595 chip.

The 74HC595 Shift Register:
---------------------------
    - Controls eight different output pins with only three input pins.
    - If you need more than 8 I/O pins you can daisy chain as many shift registers as necessary.
    - Uses technique known as bit-shifting.

How does it work?
-----------------
    - Has two 8-bit registers.
        1. Shift register
        2. Storage/Latch register
    
    Every time the 75HC595 receives a clock pulse, two things occur:

        1. Bits contained in the shift register are shifted to the left by one position.
        2. Bit 0 in the shift register accepts the current value on the DATA pin. On the rising edge of the clock pulse, if the data pin is HIGH, 1 is pushed into the shift register, otherwise 0.
