CHAPTER 24: Hygrothermograph DHT11

Projoect 24.1 Hygrothermograph
------------------------------
    What it is:
        A compound temperature and humidity sensor.
        The output digital signal has been calibrated by its manufacturer.
    
    What it does:
        Uses a customized, single-ine communication protocol. Through the library, the module's data can be read more conveniently.
    
    The DHT11 has Four Pins:
        1.  VCC
        2.  SDA
        3.  NC  !!
        4.  GND

    How it works:
        Power up the module.
        After 1 second, it will initialize.
        Its operating voltage is between 3.3V and 5.5V.

        SDA Pin:
            Data pin which is used to communicate with other devices.
        
        !! Never connect this pin to any part of the circuit!

        NC Pin (Not Connected Pin):
            A type of pin found on various integrated circuit packages. May not have have a functional purpose, except during manufacture and test.

    The DHT11 module Will give us data on two things:
        - Temperature
        - Humidity
