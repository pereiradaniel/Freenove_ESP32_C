I2C Communication
-----------------
    I2C: Inter-Integreated Circuit
    A two-wire serial communication mode.
    Can be used for the connection of micro controllers and their peripheral equipment.
    Devices using I2C communication must be connected to the serial data (SDA) line, and serial clock (SCL) line (called I2C bus).
    Each device has a unique address and can be used as a transmitter or receiver to communicate with devices connected to the bus.

LCD1602 Communication
---------------------
    LCD602 can display 2 lines of characters in 16 columns.
    It is capable of displaying numbers, letters, symbols, ASCII code, etc.

    Serial-to-parallel IC chip in the LCD1602 module is PCF8574T and its default I2C address is 0x27(0x3F).

    Only 4 pins are required to control the 16 pins of the LCD1602 screen, through the I2C interface.
