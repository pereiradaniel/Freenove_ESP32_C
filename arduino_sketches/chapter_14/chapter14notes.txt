# Project 14.1: Joystick

Joystick:
    - Type of input sensor.
    - Receives input on two axes at the same time: x and y
    - Third direction capability by pressing down: z axis
    - General structure:
        Two rotary potentiometers are at 90 degrees to each other.
        A push button in the z axis detects when the user presses down.
    
    - When the thumbstick data is read, there are some differences between the axes:
    - The data of x and y are analog, which requires the use of ADC.
    - The data of the z axis is digital, so it can be directly read with GPIO, but there is the option to use ADC for this.
