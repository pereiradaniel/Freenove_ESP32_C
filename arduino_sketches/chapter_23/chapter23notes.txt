Infrared Remote
---------------
    Device with buttons and infrared emission tube for sending signals to other devices.

Infrared Receiver
-----------------
    A component that receives infrared light emitted by the infrared remote.

    Three pins:
        1.  Data
        2.  Ground
        3.  VCC

    How it works:
        When a button on the remote is pressed, the transmitter sends a signal with the value to a receiver that decodes it.
