# CHAPTER 12: Photoresistor & LED.

# Project 12.1: Night Lamp.

- Photoresistors are sensitive the the amount of light present.
- Using a photoresistor, an LED can be adjusted to become dimmer when ambient light is bright, and brighter when ambient light is dim.

Photoresistor:
    - A light sensitive resistor.
    - Active component.
    - Has light sensitive surface.
    - Decreases resistance with luminosity.
    - Resistance value changes in proportion to the ambient light detected.
    
    Circuit for detecting change of a photoresistor's resistance value includes a 10k resistor. The diffference between the photoresistor and R1 will tell us the intensity of the light.
