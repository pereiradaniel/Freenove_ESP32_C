# Project 22.1: Matrix Keypad

4x4 Matrix Keypad
-----------------
    What is it?
        A device that integrates a number of keys in one package.
        4x4 matrix integrates 16 keys.
    
    How does it work?
        Similar to the integration of an LED matrix.
        Each row is connected with one pin, and the same for columns.
    
    How do we use it?
        Using a row or column scanning method to detect the state of each key's position by column and row.

        Column scanning method:
            Send low level to the first 1 column (pin 1), and detect level state of row 5, 6, 7, 8 to judge whether A, B, C, or D is being pressed.

            Then send low level to column 2,3,4 in turn to detect whether other keys are pressed.
