Serial Communication
--------------------

UART: Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter

    - Commonly used in electronic circuit communication.
    - Two communication lines:

        1.  Responsible for sending data (TX).
        2.  Responsible for receiving data (RX).

    * Baud rate of both sides must be the same in order for communication between devices can work.
