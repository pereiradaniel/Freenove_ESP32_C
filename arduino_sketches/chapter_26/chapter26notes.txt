CHAPTER 26: Attitude Sensor MPU 6050

Project 26.1: Read an MPU6050 Sensor Module

MPU6050
-------
    Complete 6-axis motion tracking device.
    
    Combines:
        3-axis gyroscope
        3-axis accelerometer
        DMP (Digital Motion Proccessor)
    
    Settings of the accelerometer and gyroscope can be changed.
    A precision wide range digital temperature sensor is also integrated to compensate data readings for changes in temperature.
    Temperature values can also be read.

    I2C: The MPU6050 follows the I2C communication protocol.
    Default address is 0x68.

    The MPU6050 module is widely used to assist with balancing vehicles, robots, and aircraft, mobile phones, and other products which require stability control or sensing.
