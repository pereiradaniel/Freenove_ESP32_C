CHAPTER 27: Bluetooth
=====================

Objective: Introduce how to perform a simple data transmission through the Bluetooth capability of the ESP32-WROVER and a mobile phone.


Project 27.1: Bluetooth Passthrough
-----------------------------------

    This prjoect requires the use of a Bluetooth APP called Serial Bluetooth Terminal:

    What is Bluetooth?

    A short-distance communication system.
    
    Can be divided into two types:

        1. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).
        2. Classic Bluetooth.
    
    There are two models for simple data transmission:

        1. Master Mode

            - Work is done in the master device, which can search and select slave devices nearby to connect with.

            - When a device initiates a connection request in master mode, it requires information from the other Bluetooth devices including their addresses and paring passkeys.

            - After finishing pairing, it can connect with them directly.
        
        2. Slave Mode

            - A Bluetooth module running in slave mode can only accept connection requests from a host computer. It cannot initiate a connection request.

            - After connecting with the host device, it can send data to or receive from the host device.

    
    When mobile phones exchange data with the ESP32, they are usually in master mode, while the ESP32 is usually in slave mode.
