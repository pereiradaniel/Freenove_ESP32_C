CHAPTER 28: Bluetooth Media by DAC

ESP32 integrates Classic Bluetooth and Low Energy Bluetooth (BLE).

It can transmit not just simple data, but also files such as text and audio.

Project 28.1: Playing Bluetooth Music through DAC.

Objective: Use the Bluetooth audio receiving function of the ESP3 to transcode the audio data from a mobile phone, and play the musci through the DAC output pin.

8 bit accuracy:
    The accuracy of ESP32's DAC is only eight bits, so the adio will be distorted to some extent.

Signal Conversion

    Bluetooth devices receive music data from mobile devices which cannot be played through earphones or speakers directly.

    To output a DAC signal, Bluetooth devices have to decode the data with an I2S decoding chip.

    The power of these audio signals is so small that only low-power devices can be driven, such as an earphone. The DAC signal must be powered by an amplifier chip in order to be played from devices that require more power.
